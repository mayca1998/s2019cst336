                <p>Java is an object oriented programming language created in the early 90s by a team led by James Gosling for Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle. It is considered a high level programminglanguage
                because humans are able to read and write it easily.</p>
    
                <p>Originally the programming language was called "Oak" and its goal was to implemnt a virtual machine and a language that was similar to 
                C-like notations but more simpilistic with greated uniformity than C or C++. Its first implementation was in 1995 witht the release of Java 1.0. Java was originally desdinged to be used by digital mobile devices, like cellphones. Once Java 1.0 was released to the public,
                the main focus shifted to the use of the internet. This provided interactivity with users by giving developers a way to produce animated webpages.</p>
                <p>The list of the 5 main goals the Java Programmers were aiming for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It should use the object-oriented programming methodology.</li>
                    <li>It should allow the same program to be executed on multiple operating systems.</li>
                    <li>It should contain built-in support for using computer networks.</li>
                    <li>It should be designed to execute code from remote sources securely.</li>
                    <li>It should be easy to use by selecting what was considered the good parts of other object-oriented languages..</li>
                </ul>
