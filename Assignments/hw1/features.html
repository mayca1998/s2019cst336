                <p>Java is greatly influenced by C++, but Java does have its own features that give its own advantage over other programming languages. 
                Although there are still some aspects where other programming languages can be better, Java has various features that make it stand out.
                The team of creators were sucessful in making Java a robust, secure, easy to use and portable programming language.</p>
    
                <p>Here is a list features that makes Java a strong language:</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li><span class = "words">Platform Independency</span>: During the compilation of a Java program a bytecode class is generated and this file can run on any 
                    platform having JVM installed. Byte code is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by the JVM.</li>
                    <li><span class = "words">No pointers</span>: I enjoy listening to any genre of music, as long as it sounds good.</li>
                    <li><span class = "words">Software Development</span>: I enjoy drawing and painting in various art mediums.</li>
                    <li><span class = "words">Android development</span>: I love books more than anything, but I don't have much time to read lately.</li>
                </ul>
