                <p>I'm an Undergraduate Junior studying Computer Science focusing in Software Engineering. I am currently enrolled in a three year program known as CS-in-3, that offers a pathway for a Bachelor degree in Computer Science in only three years. I am enrolled in Hartnell Community college, where I will be attaining an A.S. in Computer Science on May of 2019. I am also enrolled and plan on getting my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from CSUMB in May of 2020.
                 I want to encourage and motivate minority students, such as myself, into the STEM field. I am working as an Assistant Instructor for Coder Dojo, a non-profit open source learning opportunity for k-12 students in Monterey County.
                 I am currently looking for an internship for the Summer of 2019, where I hope to work with and learn form Software Engineers in the Tech Industry.</p>
